# Why I built WriteBase
Markdown Editor. All Data Visible. My Process.

I'm a writer, not a developer. I do design and information architecture. For years, I hunted for a writing app with minimal design, real focus, and database-level automation flexibility. I tried them all. Ulysses looked great, but it locked me in. Then came AI and Agents, and they disrupted everything again

I got stuck in the automation world: endless "tools", copy-and-pray workflows, and black boxes. The architecture is a mess. Big players like Microsoft and Google are patching legacy systems. I hit a wall and realized I didn't even know what I was building toward. So I used the only tool I had left: my brain. I started thinking like an architect.


**Nothing felt like mine. I had lost all control.**

So I built *WriteBase*. A simple Markdown editor with real power. It connects to my own Airtable base, which becomes the foundation for whatever I want to build. My words. My structure. My data. No features I won't use. Just a clean space to write, and a foundation I control. From there, I can build agents I define.

> I had never seen my data before. Now I do.

If you know, you know what this means.

And because I'm an Airtable fan, I keep building: AI agents, workflows, and a web of relations worth having. I build pipelines to GitHub Pages, wikis, Substack, and whatever I can automate. Of course, it can be integrated with Zapier or Make.

## My "must-have" feature list
- A clean Markdown editor.
- For all my writing: work, blog, and fiction.
- An editor with the support I need while writing.
- AI agents I define (easy to edit).
- An Airtable backend with full data ownership.
- A process that is mine, different for context.
