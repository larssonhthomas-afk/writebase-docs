### Header 3

Paragraph of much text in this that we write long text **about**. Now and in ***the*** future of writing, it is [always](url) there. Always on top.  

New row gives this in a new Paragraph. Yes, how convenient.

`New Paragraph. Is this with linebreaks in HTML or does it just become one long, long row?`

Could you combine with before? New row.  

**bold**
*italic*
***bold italic***
~~strikethrough~~

And we will have a list:
1. First line.
2. Second line.
3. Third Line.
