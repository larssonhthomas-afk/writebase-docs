## Header 2

### Header 3

Paragraph of much text in this that we write long text **about**. Now and in ***the*** future of writing, it is [always](url) there. Always on top.  

New row gives this in a new Paragraph. Yes, how convenient.

`New Paragraph. Is this with linebreaks in html or does it just becomes one long long row?`

Combine with before. New row.  

**bold**
*italic*
***bold italic***
~~strikethrough~~

And we will have a list:
1. First line.
2. Second line.
3. Third Line.


- Bulletpoint 1
- Bulletpoint 2
- Bulletpoint 3
