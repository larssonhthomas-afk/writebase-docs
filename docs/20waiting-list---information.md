# Waiting list - information

Im seeking the first 8 to test this product out. You will be called the Gang of 8 and will have a special place in my heart. 

During a few months, we will test this product to the limit and see what we should fix before launching. I´m thinking weekly checkins. A chat channel somewhere. And a lot of fun testing it out.



I'm seeking people who write and need to better organize their writing data. 

You could be a content creator, a wiki producer, or just writing fiction that needs some structure. I think we have you covered.

It helps if you already use Airtable, but it is not required. You will learn :-)
