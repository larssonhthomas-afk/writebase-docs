# I Own My Writing Process

What if you could stop renting your workflow and start owning it.

## The Problem

Writing scatters. Docs pile up in one folder. Prompts live in another. AI outputs land somewhere else. You copy-paste between tabs, lose context, and rebuild the same structure every time you start a new piece.

The tools multiply. The chaos compounds.

Most AI writing setups make this worse. You feed prompts into a black box. You get output. You have no idea why it worked or how to repeat it. The AI owns the process. You just press buttons.

## The Solution

I am building a system that flips this. Airtable as the backbone. AI as a tool you direct. Everything in one place: instructions, sources, drafts, feedback.

To stress-test it, I am running a small private beta. Eight people. The Gang of 8.

This is not a product launch. It is a controlled experiment. Eight builders who write. Content creators, documentation producers, fiction writers. People who want structure and repeatability without losing ownership.

## How It Works

The system runs on Airtable. Forms collect structured inputs. Tables store everything: voice instructions, research, argument chains, drafts. Automations connect the pieces.

Airtable forms work for anyone with a browser. No account required. According to [Airtable's documentation](https://support.airtable.com/docs/building-and-sharing-forms-in-airtable), "Anyone with access to open up a form share link in a browser can submit a form response."

This matters. Testers can submit feedback, flag problems, and request features without friction.

The beta structure:

- **Weekly check-ins.** Short async updates. What worked. What broke. What needs fixing.
- **Shared channel.** Direct access to me and other testers. Real-time problem-solving.
- **Structured feedback loops.** Forms for specific input. Not open-ended surveys.

Airtable runs both private and public betas this way. Sign-up forms, feedback forms, documentation. The infrastructure exists.

One design decision worth noting: I am keeping all beta participants in a single submissions table linked to the program, not splitting them across separate tables. A community discussion on [tracking beta program sign-ups](https://community.airtable.com/base-design-9/how-to-track-beta-program-participant-sign-ups-31767) put it clearly: "Personally I'd just have one table that contained all the form submissions for all the programs instead of having one table per program." Cleaner aggregation. Less maintenance pain.

## What Testers Get

Access to the full system. The Airtable base. The prompt templates. The automation workflows. The voice instruction framework.

You see how everything connects. You can fork it, modify it, break it.

In return, I need honest feedback. What confuses you. What slows you down. What you wish existed.

Eight people is small by design. Enough to surface real problems. Small enough to iterate fast.

## The Ownership Principle

Every piece of this system stays under your control.

Your voice instructions. Your data. Your output. The AI follows your rules. It does not set them.

Most writing tools hide the machinery. You cannot see the prompts. You cannot adjust the logic. You cannot export your setup and run it somewhere else.

This system exposes everything. You own the instructions. You own the process. You can rebuild it without me.

AI works for me. Not the other way around.
