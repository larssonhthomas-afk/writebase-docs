### Core Message
A small “Gang of 8” beta turns a messy writing workflow into a system you control, with Airtable as the backbone and AI as a tool you direct.

### Audience
Builders who write.
Content creators, wiki/documentation producers, and fiction writers who want structure and repeatability without losing ownership.

### Structure
1. Hook: “I own my writing process.”
2. Problem: Writing scatters across docs, tabs, prompts, and tools.
3. Solution: A controlled beta with 8 testers (“Gang of 8”) to stress-test the system.
4. How it works: Weekly check-ins + shared channel + Airtable base/forms for inputs + feedback loops.
5. End line: “AI works for me.”

Gaps:
- What the product is called and what it outputs (templates, workflows, automations, prompts). [NEEDS SOURCE]
- What “test to the limit” means (metrics, success criteria). [NEEDS SOURCE]
- Where the chat channel lives (Slack, Discord, etc.). [NEEDS SOURCE]

### Sources
Supporting 1
- Claim: Airtable runs both private and public betas, and public betas may include sign-up and feedback forms.
- Source: Airtable Help Center — “Airtable Public Betas”(https://support.airtable.com/docs/airtable-public-betas)
- Quote: "At Airtable, there is a mix of private and public betas. Private betas are not listed below."  
  "Sometimes a sign-up form for the beta will be posted with the article. If you have feedback, then a feedback form will also be available in the article."

Supporting 2
- Claim: Airtable forms can collect submissions from people without Airtable accounts via a share link.
- Source: Airtable Help Center — “Building and sharing forms in Airtable”(https://support.airtable.com/docs/building-and-sharing-forms-in-airtable)
- Quote: "Collaborators with and without Airtable accounts - Anyone with access to open up a form share link in a browser can submit a form response."

Counter-argument
- Claim: Splitting participants into one table per beta/program creates unavoidable aggregation pain; a single submissions table linked to programs is cleaner.
- Source: Airtable Community — “How to track Beta Program participant sign-ups”(https://community.airtable.com/base-design-9/how-to-track-beta-program-participant-sign-ups-31767)
- Quote: "Personally I'd just have one table that contained all the form submissions for all the programs instead of having one table per program."

NOT FOUND: “Weekly check-ins are the best cadence for early beta testers.”
NOT FOUND: “A chat channel is required for successful beta programs.”

### Argument Chain
[Observation] → Writing work fragments across tools, prompts, and files.  
[Mechanism] → A small, committed cohort feeds structured inputs (forms) and structured feedback (weekly check-ins) into one system you control.  
[Conclusion] → You improve the workflow fast while keeping ownership of instructions, data, and output. AI stays subordinate.
