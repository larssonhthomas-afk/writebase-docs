# Waiting list - and the Gang of 8

I'm seeking the first 8 to test this product out. You will be called the Gang of 8 and will have a special place in my heart. 

This is not a product launch. It is a controlled experiment. Eight builders who write. Content creators, documentation producers, fiction writers. People who want structure and repeatability without losing ownership.

Over the next few months, we will test this product to the limit and identify what to fix before launch. I´m thinking weekly check-ins. A chat channel somewhere. And a lot of fun testing it out.

Who are you?

You could be a content creator, a wiki producer, or just writing fiction that needs some structure. I think you are covered.

It helps if you already use Airtable, but it is not required. You will learn and love the structure it can give you.
