# Waiting list - information

Im seeking the first 8 to test this product out. You will be called the Gang of 8 and will have a special place in my heart. 

During a few months, we will test this product to the limit and see what we should fix before launching. I´m thinking weekly checkins. 

If you are interested in what we are building, you should be on the waiting list. In a short while (when we have tested as much of the product as we can), you will be one of the first 10 to test and be involved in further product development.

I'm seeking people who write and need to better organize their writing data. 

You could be a content creator, a wiki producer, or just writing fiction that needs some structure. I think we have you covered.

It helps if you already use Airtable, but it is not required. You will learn :-)
