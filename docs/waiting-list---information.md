# Waiting list - information

If you are interested in what we are building, you should be on the waiting list. In a short while (when we have tested as much of the product as we can), you will be one of the first 10 to test and be involved in further product development.

I'm seeking people who write and need to better organize their writing data. 

You could be a content creator, a wiki producer, or just writing fiction that needs some structure. I think we have you covered.

It helps if you already use Airtable, but it is not required. You will learn :-)
